## CodeLens Graph — Mandatory Search Protocol

This workspace has a live codebase knowledge graph via **CodeLens Graph** MCP.
The graph contains **135 symbols** across **19 files**, updated on every save.

### RULE 1 — Triage first to establish the baseline
Before starting a task, call `codelens_triage` to classify it.
Use the triage response to pick the most efficient tool path. You have full flexibility to choose other tools as necessary:
- **Tier 1 (typo/formatting)**: No tools needed.
- **Tier 2 (symbol lookup / search)**: Call `codelens_search` (for classes, functions, types) or `codelens_text_search` (for strings, comments, local variables).
- **Tier 3 (features / bugfixes)**: Start with `codelens_context`. Use `mode: "short"` to quickly see the file/symbol map (cheapest), or `mode: "deep"` only if you need full implementations.
- **Tier 4 (refactoring)**: Use `codelens_context` + `codelens_impact` to map dependencies and prevent breaking changes.

### RULE 2 — Use specific tools instead of scanning files
Avoid generic workspace scans (grep, ls, find) or reading whole files. Use these targeted tools:
| Task / Need | Recommended Tool | Why It Saves Tokens |
|---|---|---|
| Locate symbol definition | `codelens_search` | Returns exact file:line + signature |
| Search text, comments, or strings | `codelens_text_search` | Searches line-by-line using fuzzy text index |
| Inspect 1 class/function code | `codelens_node` (with `with_snippet: true`) | Avoids reading the whole file containing it |
| Understand feature context | `codelens_context` | Returns a minimal subgraph of only related files |
| Find callers/callees of a function | `codelens_relations` | Lists callers, callees, or both for a given symbol |
| See transitive dependencies | `codelens_impact` | Automatically runs BFS to map the blast radius |
| Check directory structure | `codelens_files` | Returns category-grouped file list |

### RULE 3 — Read only what CodeLens points to
When CodeLens tools return a `file:line` range, read only that specific range using the `view_file` tool (with StartLine and EndLine).
Do NOT read whole files, and never read files that are not listed in the graph response.

### RULE 4 — Check before creating
Before writing a new function, class, or file, run `codelens_search` to ensure you are not creating a duplicate. Duplication is the #1 source of code rot.

### RULE 5 — Keep the graph updated
The knowledge graph is updated automatically on file save. You can run `codelens_status` to verify the index is healthy and up to date.

### RULE 6 — Query dependencies and configs strategically
Only search for package dependencies, type definitions, or configuration files (like package.json, tsconfig.json) when asked or if context is missing.
Use `codelens_search` or `codelens_files` with `scope: "deps"`, or use `codelens_dependencies` directly.
